### Overview of Fortnite Free Rewards

Fortnite has been delivering free rewards to players since its launch in 2017. These rewards are accessible through various methods, including completing in-game challenges, participating in events, or claiming them via the item shop. Some rewards are part of a limited-time event, while others are available year-round. The inclusion of free rewards plays a key role in keeping the game exciting and accessible to both free-to-play and premium players alike.

The concept of free rewards in Fortnite revolves around rewarding player participation. Whether it’s cosmetics, battle passes, skins, V-Bucks, or other in-game items, Fortnite provides players with incentives to keep coming back.
